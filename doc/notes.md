# Notes

A placeholder for ideas for the game.

## Gameplay

The board has N spaces.  Each space is in a region.  Some cards apply only to certain regions or certain spaces.  Positive helper cards can be accumulated with a hand limit of H=4.  Negative helper cards should be played right away on the player that drew it.

In a "Find Luna" game, collect "Paw Prints" (or Dog Treats?).  Getting to the end firt is worth D=10 tokens.  Second gets D/2 tokens.  Quests are worth a certain number of tokens.  Some cards will give you tokens.  Exchange Future Turn tokens and Helper Cards for tokens at the end.

Might add a detour - one route is longer than the other.  You can collect potentially more points on the long route, but is it too long that you don't get to the rest?

Bidding on something at junctures in the road.

Gas station space (draw a card).  How do you move past this?  
* This could be exchange helpers for points.  Points are listed on the helper card.  Different gas station have different multiplier
* Points tokens?  Maybe just use cards... what about multipliers?

Use dog tags as player tokens.

Some helpers are side quests.  Hold them in your hand until you complete them.  Complete them by doing silly things.  Side quests can be worth points at the end.

Have some kind of Final Quest cards that give points to other players in funny ways.  These are at the end of the game.  Maybe pick one for a variety of outcomes.

## Events

* Taiko drumming (Jon, Cat, Carl)
