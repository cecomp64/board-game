# Notes

A placeholder for ideas for the game.

## Gameplay

The board has N spaces.  Each space is in a region.  Some cards apply only to certain regions or certain spaces.  Positive helper cards can be accumulated with a hand limit of H=4.  Negative helper cards should be played right away on the player that drew it.

In a "Find Luna" game, collect "Paw Prints" (or Dog Treats?).  Getting to the end firt is worth D=10 tokens.  Second gets D/2 tokens.  Quests are worth a certain number of tokens.  Some cards will give you tokens.  Exchange Future Turn tokens and Helper Cards for tokens at the end.

Might add a detour - one route is longer than the other.  You can collect potentially more points on the long route, but is it too long that you don't get to the rest?

Bidding on something at junctures in the road.

Gas station space.

Use dog tags as player tokens.
